### Hey what’s up?

🙋‍♂ I’m Dom, a designer, developer, and maker. You can usually find me pushing pixels, committing code, and making things happen on the web. My approach is pragmatic and collaborative: I want to leave every project better than I found it, which includes the people I work with. Teaching everything I know is what gets me out of bed each morning. Empowering others to get their work done both better and faster is deeply ingrained in everything I do.
